# Least-Squares Fitting Methods in Maple

This repository contains the analysis performed in a Maple worksheet. The project explores and compares three different methods of fitting a line to a dataset using the principle of least squares:

1.  **Minimizing Vertical Distances (Standard OLS):** The traditional least-squares method.
2.  **Minimizing Horizontal Distances:** An alternative approach assuming errors primarily in the x-values.
3.  **Minimizing Absolute Euclidean Distance:** A method that considers errors in both x and y values.

## Contents

* `Least_Squares_Fitting.mw`: The original Maple worksheet.
* `Least_Squares_Fitting.pdf`: A PDF export of the Maple worksheet, providing a readable overview of the methods, data, results, and plots.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to implement and compare these three least-squares fitting techniques using Maple's `Statistics` and `Optimization` packages. The analysis highlights the different assumptions underlying each method and discusses their potential applications and limitations.

The PDF provides a detailed explanation of the methodology, the Maple code used, the resulting fitted lines, and visualizations comparing the three methods.

## Viewing the Results

For the most accessible overview of this project, please refer to the `Least-Squares-Fitting.pdf` file. This document contains the problem description, the methods used, the results (including equations of the fitted lines), and the plots generated in Maple.

The original Maple worksheet (`Least_Squares_Fitting.mw`) is included for users who have access to Maple and wish to examine the original code and analysis.
